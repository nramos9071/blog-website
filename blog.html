        <p>Blog Title: Spells are better than Melee</p> <br/>
        <p> Blog: My character is a cleric/sorcerer and I have not used melee once. Most of my attacks are spells and I have done 
            well in my campaign. Melee seems so boring compared to spells. Melee only has one option. Granted you can attack more than once
            in some cases and you can only cast one spell at a time. But even with that being said, I still think spells are better.

        <p>Blog Title: Fireball</p> <br/>
        <p>Blog: I am a wizard in my campaign and I have an issue. I'm scared to use Fireball. I know that it is powerful and strong. 
            But I am afraid of hurting my party. I can see how useful it is to clear out large amounts of enemies. But I'm afraid to cast it
            and damage my friends. Does anyone else feel the same?
